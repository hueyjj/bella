bella isn't a very strong girl, so please don't ask her to do something she can't. 
For bella to work she needs...
1. win32 api (windows)
2. youtube-dl (runnable through shell)

##### why bella was made
Often times good music stuff on youtube come up, so downloading them by command line was annoying. bella is just and only just some global keys to run some commands. bella could have been stronger but his creator decided to write it in just C and, horribly, with windows api. Her creator has learned a valuable lesson. bella needed to be raised with the modern, popular kids.
