Known issues:
- Unable to set bindings starting with alt modifier. 
    For some reason, the binding interferes with the copy-to-clipboard operation.  When alt+somekey is pressed, releasing somekey 
    and then alt modifier allows the copy-to-clipboard operation to work. But when the alt modifier is released first and then 
    somekey, the copy-to-clipboard operation fails. I actually have no clue why it fails. Google searches escape me.
    Somethings things I have tried but not limited to: GetKeyState(), GetAsyncKeyState(), GetKeyboardState(), SetKeyboardState().

- Unable to use bella after a sytem restart or initial start up of main system
    For some reason, bella is unable to get the clip board handle after a system restart.
    I am unsure why, but after using the clipboard once (control + c any text).
    Bella works as normal. So I am guessing the system needs to register the clipboard handle
    to the system (???).
