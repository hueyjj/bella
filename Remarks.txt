Known issues:
- Unable to set bindings starting with alt modifier. 
    For some reason, the binding interferes with the copy-to-clipboard operation.  When alt+somekey is pressed, releasing somekey 
    and then alt modifier allows the copy-to-clipboard operation to work. But when the alt modifier is released first and then 
    somekey, the copy-to-clipboard operation fails. I actually have no clue why it fails. Google searches escape me.
    Somethings things I have tried but not limited to: GetKeyState(), GetAsyncKeyState(), GetKeyboardState(), SetKeyboardState().
